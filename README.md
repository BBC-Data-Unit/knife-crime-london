# London knife crime rises to four-year high

![](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/knife-crime-london/blob/master/London%20boroughs%20with%20worst%20knife%20crime.png)

In September we created charts to illustrate a [story on a rise in stabbings in London](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37412508).

The data was taken from a [London Assembly Tableau dashboard](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/mayors-office-policing-and-crime-mopac/data-and-research/crime%20/gangs-dashboard). However, the London Assembly had not made it possible to download the raw data, so the unit had to manually input the data into a spreadsheet. We have made that data available below.

## Data

* [Knife crime injuries Aug 2015 to Aug 2016: top 10 London boroughs](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/knife-crime-london/blob/master/knifecrimelondon.csv)
